******Security Issue******
ISSUE 1(SOLUTION NEED) {fixed check user access problem 1 for solution}
User can logout but can use the go back button on the browser to see other pages that where open when the user was logged in.
* Possible Solution
    * using an if statement to on every webpage to check UserStatus, if 0 go back to index.php, other way upload.

******Solution******

********************************
*    User access problem 1     *
********************************
Solution by using switch statement. e.g.
switch ($_SESSION['UserStatus']) {
  case 1:
    include 'include/Staff_Nav.php';
    break;
  case 2:
    include 'include/Admin_Nav.php';
    break;
  default:
    header('location: index.php');
    break;
}
Meaning if a user does not have a recognised  'UserStatus'
********************************
* END OF USER ACCESS PROBLEM 1 *
